* in a way, a game is a simulation of an experience, what would it be like to be in this situation, and what would i do, how could would i be if i had to do it. and once you finish the game, you have had an experience and learned from it and gained new skill and understanding

* the game designer can choose what the skill of the game is, and what mechanics matter most in this world
  - the game world can have a slice dimension of the real world, and in a sense, you are using skills that would apply to the real world.
  - eg, driving game, fighting game, cooking, spy, survival, military general
  - however, the skills represented in the game are always very different from those skills in real life
  - if you limit the world and offer limited tools, and you show the player how they can get more powerful, then they will try to get it,
  - the game should start with easy mechanics, and offer more ability and more mechanics as rewards for progression. in a way, it makes sense, you are giving them a learning curve and an exponential state of flow
  - they dont become skillful because they want to, they become skillful as a indirect result of hustling to overcome the challenge, because theyre so driven
  - if the player has, for the game, attention, understanding, focus, momentum and a plan, then when a challenge comes up, they will hit the challenge over and over until they overcome it, each time they effectively repeat action toward the idea their skill increases
