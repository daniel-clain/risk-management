* unskilled labor
  - task that requires no skills but takes a long time regardless

* expert
  - all puzzles are solved quickly all the information of the thing is revealed

* you do it cos you fear the outcome
  - visible sub thing
    ~ in 10 seconds, this thing will exprie and the cost will be -$20,000, -90% feeling
  - semi revealed thing
    ~ outcome is first sub thing goes away
    ~ requirements a low requirement for knowledge and skill, but there are lots of them
    ~ as you 'think' about the 'puzzle' you have a chance each second to discover one of the 'discoverableThings'
      * discoverableThings can be more clarity on a subThing, a tangent thing, a new sub thing

* you flip a coin with a 50/50 chance to make make $10

* 2 things are expiring at the same time, the clarity is 100%, the work skill is 0, the time it takes the do the thing for each of them it too long to do both, so you have to choose 




addition
-----------------

* focus of the game is fun
  - fun comes from the skill in understanding the environment, options, challenges
  - fun comes from working hard to do what you want to do, then discovering there is more to do

* 1) how do you make them want to do it
  - put them in the game with no instructions


* 2) how do you make them want to do it
  - give them a game and say try to beat it
    ~ 1st level is to give an introduction to the bare minimum
    ~ 2nd level is to introduce to them a prime concept
    ~ 3rd level is to challenge them 
    ~ 4th is reward for challenge

* i need examples to flesh out what mechanics are base and what are long term extended


main concepts example
======================
* good oppotunities come up, get them while you can, if you miss out it will be a big loss
* if you ignore a little, it can grow exponentially
* some thing may have a great pay off, a risk of failure and a small small failure penalty. if the risk is high enough, then the over-all risk value is tilted from positive to negative making it a bad option



examples of things
==================
* make toast
* job interview
* need to vote
* need to look for a job
* need to renew passport
* need to do amazon work
* flip a coin

examples of test scenarios
===========================
*if you want a, but b is blocking you, your motivation is a but your focus is b
  - the test is, once you solve the challenge, you will not learn from solving b because you valued a, and thus you make the same mistake again, because you didnt stop to 


/* 

  * You can have a thought about a thing
    - you can choose to do the thing
    - doing it might cost you, not doing it might cost you
    - sometimes its better to do nothing
    - sometimes theres a great thing and you forget and ur mad

/* 
  * decisions
    - triggers chain of events, state change
    - put off a decision
    - decision outcome changes over time, events can bet triggered by time
