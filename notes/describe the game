* as you think about something, depending on you intelligence and random chance you may figure something out
* as you practice something your skill gets better
* when you are confronted by a new thing at first you have little understanding, but the more you try to figure it out, the better you understand it
  - you dont know how much time is left for a future event, so you investigate, and learn the answer
* when you work work on something that has a low degree of skill it takes about the same amount of time for anyone to do
  - but if you work on something that has high skill potential, then people with low skill will do it a lot slower than people with high skill
  - the more you work on a skilled thing the more you gain skills in that area
  - skills deminish over time up to a 2/3 of its highest height
  
* as you figure out puzzles your knowledge grows
