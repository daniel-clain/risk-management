* the way ive divided work, puzzle and future event seems wrong

* work is supposed to be laborious, mindless effort. eg washing the dishes, laying bricks, hanging the washing, working out at the gym

* puzzle is supposed to be something of the mind, where muscles and fitness mean nothing

* one of the original idea i had for the game is the concept of 'clarity'
  - the idea is, that if there is a thing, and you have low clarity on it, then you perceive it in an incomplete way that doesnt make sense, full of puzzles/mystery. you have so little understanding for it that you dont know what the best or worst outcome is, you simply need more information
    ~ eg how long do i have left, whats in it for me, what if i dont, do i have to deal with it now or can i leave it for later
  - the idea of clarity is you take action to gain information about the thing, and as you take time to act and learn new info, you get a clearer understanding of what you are dealing with, and therefore you can make better judgement

* mechanics for the game in relation to clarity
  - eg, 
    ~ a thing has 0.1 clarity
    ~ you know it has a future event that it will finish in 3 days
    ~ you dont know that it has a work action with the outcome of $1000
