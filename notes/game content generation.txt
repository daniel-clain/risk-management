* i think it will be hard and take ages to come up with different levels
* my idea is to make code that generates random challenges
  - then i play test them, and either mark them as a bad challenge and amend my algorithm, or i save the generated challenge and give it a difficulty rating
* in theory, after ive added several challenges, then the game can generate levels, 1 - 100 based on all the saved challenges
  - so if ive rated sever challenges as easy, then they will be in the first 5 levels, but if ive rated challenges as very hard, then they will make up the levels of teh game
  

* puzzle mechanic
  - up to 5 levels
  - number of levels unknown, could be 1
  - each attempt has a chance to go to the next level based on skill
  - after solving the last level, you get the outcome
  - each levels skill challenge can be different but always within 10 of the last one
  - each level solved reveals an extra portion of clarity, 
  - clarity doesnt move up linear, it moves up in random chunks, when levels are randomly revealed
  - the player has to judge whether the probability is high enough to keep trying or try something else
