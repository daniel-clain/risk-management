when you go to do a task, if the task has a skill requirement
  - your skill is tested agains the skill requirement
  - same for knowledge, same as skill
  - skill is your test for completing the task, knowledge is your test for understanding the task
  - if you work on a task while it is in an unclear state, you will not be sure of the outcome, the probailities of outcomes will be affected and you information will be inacurate
  - if you think about a puzzle, you have a probability of figuring it out over time, the higher your skill the higher your chance to succeed
    ~ the puzzle tier has many level, the last one completes the challenge, the levels show progress of the puzzle ( puzzle progression / thought is not linear, it take random jumps up)
    ~ each tier has its own skill check, all levels are random but are withing an overall range of eachother
    ~ if the current skill check is too high then the player may feel forced to give up that puzzle
  - players efficiency to fulfill a task is exponentially relative
    ~ if the puzzle's knowledge requirement is X, and the  players knowledge in that same area
      * if the skill requirement is 5 and players skill is 5, then they will complete that action in 10 seconds
      * if the skill requirement is 5 and the players skill is 4, then complete in 11 seconds
      * if the skill requirement is 5 and the players skill is 3 then complete in 13 seconds
      * if skill req 5 and player skill 2, 17
      * if req 5 and player skill 1, 22
